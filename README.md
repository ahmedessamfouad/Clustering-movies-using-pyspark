# Movie Clustering with PySpark

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use PySpark for clustering movies based on their features. The dataset used contains information about movies, such as genres, ratings, and release year.
We apply K-means clustering algorithm to group similar movies together.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a sample movie dataset containing the following columns: 
- Title: Title of the movie
- Genres: Genres of the movie
to get data https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

## Usage
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Cluster movies in pyspark.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the code cells.
4. Experiment with different parameters and algorithms for clustering movies.

## Files
- `Cluster movies in pyspark.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for clustering movies.
- `movies.csv`: Sample dataset containing movie information.

## Results
The clustering results are presented visually using scatter plots and other visualizations in the notebook. Users can analyze the clusters formed and interpret the results to gain insights into the movie dataset.
